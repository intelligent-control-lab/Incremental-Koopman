## Abstract
<div align = "center"><img src="assets/algo_overview.png" width="95%" /> </div>

### Project Features and Contributions  

- **Incremental Koopman Algorithm**: We propose an **incremental Koopman algorithm** tailored for high-dimensional legged robot dynamics, enabling continual learning and refinement of Koopman linearization.  

- **Continual Learning Mechanism**: By **progressively expanding the training dataset and the latent space dimension**, our method improves the Koopman linearization, effectively reducing approximation errors.  

- **Theoretical Convergence Guarantee**: We provide a **theoretical analysis and guarantee** that the learned Koopman dynamics converge to the true Koopman dynamics.  

- **First Data-Driven Koopman Control for High-Dimensional Legged Robots**: This work is the **first** to implement **data-driven Koopman-based whole-body dynamics linearization** combined with **linear MPC controllers** for locomotion control of high-dimensional legged robots.  

- **Reduced Dependence on Domain Expertise and Improved Generalization**: Compared to traditional Koopman approaches, our method **reduces reliance on expert knowledge** and enhances generalizability across different tasks.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Follow the installation steps of [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab). Make sure to install `rsl_rl` during the installation process. 
- Notice that our code is tested on [IsaacLab v2.0.2](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/releases/tag/v2.0.2).

### Training

- Activate the environment built by IsaacLab.

- Initiate the codes for isaaclab, training RL data collector, build initial dataset and build reference repository.
    ```
    ./init.sh <Path to IsaacLab Root Dir> <Task Type> <Specifide Data Dir>
    ```
    - Here `<Path to IsaacLab Root Dir>` is the location of your IsaacLab Repository, `<Task Type>` is your wanted task type (choices are `unitree_go2_flat`, `unitree_a1_flat`, `anymal_d_flat`, `g1_flat`, `h1_flat`) and `<Specifide Data Dir>` is your specified data saving directory. 
    - Initial dataset will be saved to `<Specifide Data Dir>/<Task Type>/initial_dataset` and reference repository will be saved to `<Specifide Data Dir>/<Task Type>/reference_repository/`
    - RL data collector checkpoints and videos for visualizing the generating process will be saved to `<Path to IsaacLab Root Dir>/logs/rsl_rl/<Task Type>/`

- Build dynamics based on current dataset and generate tracking data with MPC data collector.
    ```
    ./iterate.sh <Path to IsaacLab Root Dir> <Task Type> <Specifide Data Dir>
    ```
    - Trained Koopman Dynamics model will be saved to `Incremental-Koopman/logs/<Task Type>/Iter<Num>_<Running Time>`. Here `Iter<Num>` represents the number of current iteration which actually depends on the files number in `<Specifide Data Dir>/<Task Type>/tracking_dataset/`. 
    - Tracking dataset generated by MPC data generator and current Koopman Dynamics will be saved to `<Specifide Data Dir>/<Task Type>/tracking_dataset/`.
    - Repeat running this file will iteratively train Koopman dynamics.
    - Please check `configs/<Task Type>.txt` for specific training hyperparameters for each iteration.

### Visualizing
```
./visualize.sh <Path to IsaacLab Root Dir> <Task Type> <Koopman Log Dir> <Path to Reference Repository>
```
- Here `<Koopman Log Dir>` is the specific Koopman dynamics model you want to test and `<Path to Reference Repository>` is path to your wanted reference repository.
- Videos will be saved to `<Path to IsaacLab Root Dir>/logs/rsl_rl/<Task Type>/`.
